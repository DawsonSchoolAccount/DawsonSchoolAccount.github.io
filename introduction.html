            So just what can Taylor <em>do?</em> Great question! Having almost
            achieved a Master's Degree in Computer Science, I have ammassed a
            number of different skills. For example, I consider myself
            proficient in the following programming languages, ranked in order
            of how much I like the language:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Java</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I also have decent experience (but wouldn't consider myself
            <strong>proficient</strong>) in the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Visual Basic</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <aside class="school-box">
          <p>
            I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Weber State
            University, where I graduated Cum Laude with a GPA of 3.76. Go
            Wildcats!

          <p>
            Obviously I'm working on my Master's degree at Utah State, and I
            hope to graduate in Spring 2022. Aggies are okay, I guess.
